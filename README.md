![Hangman Demo](img/demo.gif) *Example gameplay (replace with actual GIF path)*

This Hangman game isn’t just about guessing words – it’s an **immersive experience**! Built in C++ with SDL2, it features:

- 🎨 **Animated graphics** (watch the hangman being drawn stroke by stroke!).
- 🌍 **Multiple categories** (Fruits 🍎, Countries 🌏, Jobs 👨⚕️, Plants 🌿).
- ⚡ **Two difficulty modes** (Easy for kids, Hard for pros!).
- 💡 **Smart suggestions** (stuck? Get a hint!).
- ⏳ **90-second timer** (race against time!).
- 📊 **Score tracking** (brag about your wins!).

## 🧠 Code Overview

### 🕹️ `main.cpp`
- **Entry Point**: Initializes SDL, runs the game loop.
```cpp
int main() {
    SkickSDL sdl; // Initialize SDL
    Game game;     // Create game instance
    while (game.isRunning()) {
        game.handleEvents(); // Process input
        game.update();       // Update timer/game state
        game.render();      // Draw everything
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### 🎲 `Game.cpp`
- **Core Logic**: Manages guesses, win/lose conditions.
```cpp
void Game::handleGuess(char guess) {
    if (alreadyGuessed(guess)) return; // Ignore repeats
    if (wordContains(guess)) {
        revealLetter(guess); // Update currentWord
        checkWin();          // Does currentWord == wordToGuess?
    } else {
        addMistake();       // Increment mistakes
        checkLoss();         // If mistakes >=7, game over
    }
}
```

---

## 🗂️ Data Structures Used

### `std::vector<string> words`
- **Purpose**: Stores word lists loaded from text files.
```cpp
// Load all words from "words/fruits.txt"
vector<string> fruits = loadWords("words/fruits.txt");
```

### `std::unordered_map<char, bool> unguessedLetters`
- **Purpose**: Track letters not yet guessed for hints.
```cpp
for (char c : wordToGuess) {
    unguessedLetters[c] = false; // Initialize all as unguessed
}
```

---

## 📚 Libraries Used

| Library | Role | Why Chosen? |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **SDL2** | Window/Input | Lightweight, cross-platform 🖥️ |
| **SDL2_image** | PNG Loading | Supports transparency (for hangman PNGs) 🖼️ |
| **SDL2_ttf** | Font Rendering | Crisp text for UI 🅰️ |

---

## 🔍 Detailed Function Specifications

### `SkickSDL::createImageBackground()`
```cpp
/**
 * Loads a full-screen background image.
 * @param fileName Path to PNG (e.g., "img/background.png").
 * @throws SDL_Exception if image fails to load.
 */
void SkickSDL::createImageBackground(string fileName);
```

### `utility::chooseWord()`
```cpp
/**
 * Selects a random word from a category file.
 * @param fileName Path to word list.
 * @param difficulty 1 (Easy) or 2 (Hard).
 * @return A word meeting the length criteria.
 */
string chooseWord(const string& fileName, int difficulty);
```

---

## 👩💻 Line-by-Line Code Analysis

### `Game::updateTime()` (Timer Logic)
```cpp
void Game::updateTime() {
    Uint32 currentTime = SDL_GetTicks() / 1000; // Get current time in seconds
    if (currentTime - startTime >= 1) {         // 1 second elapsed
        timeLeft--;
        startTime = currentTime;
        if (timeLeft <= 0) {
            gameState = LOST; // Time's up! 💀
        }
    }
}
```
- **Line 2**: `SDL_GetTicks()` returns milliseconds since start.
- **Line 3**: Checks if a full second has passed.
- **Line 4-7**: Decrement `timeLeft`, trigger loss if 0.

# 🌟 What I Learned 🌟

Building this Hangman game was like crafting a masterpiece from scratch—I went from basic code-slinger to game-dev wizard! ✨ Before this, I knew my way around C++ and some trusty data structures (arrays, vectors, stacks, and more). But this project? It was a full-on skill explosion. Here’s the dazzling rundown of what I conquered:

## 🎨 New Powers Gained 🎨

### 🏰 Object-Oriented Magic
- **What**: Mastered classes and objects in C++.
- **How**: Built `Game`, `SkickSDL`, and `Painter` classes to rule the code kingdom.
- **Why It Rocks**: Learned encapsulation (hiding the mess) and modularity (snap-together code blocks). Goodbye, spaghetti scripts—hello, elegant systems! 🛠

### 🖼 SDL Graphics Sorcery
- **What**: Conquered the SDL library for visuals and controls.
- **How**: Drew windows, shapes, and handled keyboard spells (A-Z guesses, anyone?).
- **Why It Rocks**: Turned lifeless code into a living, breathing game. My screen’s now a canvas! 🎮

### 📜 File I/O Wizardry
- **What**: Unlocked reading text files in C++.
- **How**: Loaded word lists (Fruits 🍇, Animals 🐘) to mix up the game.
- **Why It Rocks**: My game’s dynamic now—data flows like magic from files to fun! 📂

### ✂ String Alchemy
- **What**: Became a pro at string manipulation.
- **How**: Tweaked `_ _ _ _` into `H A _ _`, tracked guesses, and tamed wild letters.
- **Why It Rocks**: Words bend to my will—Hangman’s core is mine to command! 🔠

### ⚡ Event Mastery
- **What**: Captured real-time inputs with SDL’s event system.
- **How**: Made A-Z keys guess letters and Spacebar drop hints.
- **Why It Rocks**: The game reacts instantly—players feel the power! ⌨

### 🧠 Game Logic Brilliance
- **What**: Designed a brainy game flow.
- **How**: Tracked 7 wrong guesses, flipped win/lose states, kept it all smooth.
- **Why It Rocks**: Rules run like clockwork—pure gaming bliss! ⏳

### 🛡 Error-Proof Armor
- **What**: Added shields against crashes.
- **How**: Handled missing files and odd inputs with grace.
- **Why It Rocks**: My game’s tough as nails and kind to players! 🚑

## 🌠 Epic Transformation
- **Started With**: Basic C++ and simple data tricks.
- **Now**: Crafting interactive games with graphics, files, and flair!
  
This wasn’t just a project—it was a quest. I’ve leveled up big time, and I’m ready to conquer my next coding adventure! 🚀

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)


---

### ❓ Q1: How is the word selected in the game?

**A:** At the start of the game, a random word is picked from a text file within a chosen category. The file is read into a vector, and one word is selected using `rand()` or `std::uniform_int_distribution`.

---

### 🎯 Q2: How are guesses tracked?

**A:** Every letter the player guesses is stored in a `std::set<char>` or `std::vector<char>`. Before accepting a new guess, the game checks if it was already tried. If it's a correct letter, the display is updated; if not, the player's mistake count increases.

---

### 🎨 Q3: How does the game display correct and incorrect guesses?

**A:**
- **Correct letters** replace underscores at their respective positions in the word.
- **Incorrect letters** are shown separately and increase the "hangman stage" (from 0 to 7).
- The UI updates both areas in real-time using SDL rendering.

---

### 💀 Q4: What determines game over?

**A:** Two conditions end the game:
1. **Win:** The player guesses all letters correctly.
2. **Loss:** The player makes 7 incorrect guesses, fully drawing the hangman.

The game loop checks these conditions after every input.

---

### 🕒 Q5: Is there a time limit?

**A:** Yes, there's an optional countdown timer. It starts when the game begins and decreases every second. If it hits 0 before the player finishes the word, the game ends in a loss.

---

### 📊 Q6: How is the hangman visualized?

**A:** The hangman is split into 8 PNG images (`stage0.png` to `stage7.png`). Each wrong guess increments a `stage` variable, and the corresponding image is rendered using SDL2.

---

### 📜 Q7: Can the word contain repeated letters?

**A:** Yes! The logic checks **all instances** of a guessed letter and updates them simultaneously. For example, guessing 'E' in "NEEDLE" will reveal both 'E's.

---

### 🔁 Q8: How does the main game loop work?

**A:**
1. Show current state (masked word, wrong guesses, timer)
2. Wait for SDL keyboard input
3. Check if guess is valid and update game state
4. Render changes (text + images)
5. Repeat until win/loss/timer ends

---

### 🔤 Q9: Are guesses case-sensitive?

**A:** No. The input is normalized using `tolower()` or `toupper()` so that guesses work regardless of capitalization.

---

### 🔄 Q10: What happens after a game ends?

**A:** After a win or loss:
- A message is displayed.
- Option to restart or quit is given.
- Internally, the game resets word, guesses, stage, and timer for a fresh round.



This is an awesome next step if you want to **expand** the project with a full GUI.
