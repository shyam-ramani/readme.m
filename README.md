---

## üß† Code Overview

### üïπÔ∏è `main.cpp`
- **Entry Point**: Initializes SDL, runs the game loop.
```cpp
int main() {
    SkickSDL sdl; // Initialize SDL
    Game game;     // Create game instance
    while (game.isRunning()) {
        game.handleEvents(); // Process input
        game.update();       // Update timer/game state
        game.render();      // Draw everything
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### üé≤ `Game.cpp`
- **Core Logic**: Manages guesses, win/lose conditions.
```cpp
void Game::handleGuess(char guess) {
    if (alreadyGuessed(guess)) return; // Ignore repeats
    if (wordContains(guess)) {
        revealLetter(guess); // Update currentWord
        checkWin();          // Does currentWord == wordToGuess?
    } else {
        addMistake();       // Increment mistakes
        checkLoss();         // If mistakes >=7, game over
    }
}
```

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Structures Used

### `std::vector<string> words`
- **Purpose**: Stores word lists loaded from text files.
```cpp
// Load all words from "words/fruits.txt"
vector<string> fruits = loadWords("words/fruits.txt");
```

### `std::unordered_map<char, bool> unguessedLetters`
- **Purpose**: Track letters not yet guessed for hints.
```cpp
for (char c : wordToGuess) {
    unguessedLetters[c] = false; // Initialize all as unguessed
}
```

---

## üìö Libraries Used

| Library | Role | Why Chosen? |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **SDL2** | Window/Input | Lightweight, cross-platform üñ•Ô∏è |
| **SDL2_image** | PNG Loading | Supports transparency (for hangman PNGs) üñºÔ∏è |
| **SDL2_ttf** | Font Rendering | Crisp text for UI üÖ∞Ô∏è |

---

## üîç Detailed Function Specifications

### `SkickSDL::createImageBackground()`
```cpp
/**
 * Loads a full-screen background image.
 * @param fileName Path to PNG (e.g., "img/background.png").
 * @throws SDL_Exception if image fails to load.
 */
void SkickSDL::createImageBackground(string fileName);
```

### `utility::chooseWord()`
```cpp
/**
 * Selects a random word from a category file.
 * @param fileName Path to word list.
 * @param difficulty 1 (Easy) or 2 (Hard).
 * @return A word meeting the length criteria.
 */
string chooseWord(const string& fileName, int difficulty);
```

---

## üë©üíª Line-by-Line Code Analysis

### `Game::updateTime()` (Timer Logic)
```cpp
void Game::updateTime() {
    Uint32 currentTime = SDL_GetTicks() / 1000; // Get current time in seconds
    if (currentTime - startTime >= 1) {         // 1 second elapsed
        timeLeft--;
        startTime = currentTime;
        if (timeLeft <= 0) {
            gameState = LOST; // Time's up! üíÄ
        }
    }
}
```
- **Line 2**: `SDL_GetTicks()` returns milliseconds since start.
- **Line 3**: Checks if a full second has passed.
- **Line 4-7**: Decrement `timeLeft`, trigger loss if 0.

# üåü What I Learned üåü

Building this Hangman game was like crafting a masterpiece from scratch‚ÄîI went from basic code-slinger to game-dev wizard! ‚ú® Before this, I knew my way around C++ and some trusty data structures (arrays, vectors, stacks, and more). But this project? It was a full-on skill explosion. Here‚Äôs the dazzling rundown of what I conquered:

## üé® New Powers Gained üé®

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)


---

### ‚ùì Q1: How is the word selected in the game?

**A:** At the start of the game, a random word is picked from a text file within a chosen category. The file is read into a vector, and one word is selected using `rand()` or `std::uniform_int_distribution`.

---

### üéØ Q2: How are guesses tracked?

**A:** Every letter the player guesses is stored in a `std::set<char>` or `std::vector<char>`. Before accepting a new guess, the game checks if it was already tried. If it's a correct letter, the display is updated; if not, the player's mistake count increases.

---

### üé® Q3: How does the game display correct and incorrect guesses?

**A:**
- **Correct letters** replace underscores at their respective positions in the word.
- **Incorrect letters** are shown separately and increase the "hangman stage" (from 0 to 7).
- The UI updates both areas in real-time using SDL rendering.

---

### üíÄ Q4: What determines game over?

**A:** Two conditions end the game:
1. **Win:** The player guesses all letters correctly.
2. **Loss:** The player makes 7 incorrect guesses, fully drawing the hangman.

The game loop checks these conditions after every input.

---

### üïí Q5: Is there a time limit?

**A:** Yes, there's an optional countdown timer. It starts when the game begins and decreases every second. If it hits 0 before the player finishes the word, the game ends in a loss.

---

### üìä Q6: How is the hangman visualized?

**A:** The hangman is split into 8 PNG images (`stage0.png` to `stage7.png`). Each wrong guess increments a `stage` variable, and the corresponding image is rendered using SDL2.

---

### üìú Q7: Can the word contain repeated letters?

**A:** Yes! The logic checks **all instances** of a guessed letter and updates them simultaneously. For example, guessing 'E' in "NEEDLE" will reveal both 'E's.

---

### üîÅ Q8: How does the main game loop work?

**A:**
1. Show current state (masked word, wrong guesses, timer)
2. Wait for SDL keyboard input
3. Check if guess is valid and update game state
4. Render changes (text + images)
5. Repeat until win/loss/timer ends

---

### üî§ Q9: Are guesses case-sensitive?

**A:** No. The input is normalized using `tolower()` or `toupper()` so that guesses work regardless of capitalization.

---

### üîÑ Q10: What happens after a game ends?

**A:** After a win or loss:
- A message is displayed.
- Option to restart or quit is given.
- Internally, the game resets word, guesses, stage, and timer for a fresh round.



This is an awesome next step if you want to **expand** the project with a full GUI.
