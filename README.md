## 🕹️ How to Play
### Objective: 
Guess the hidden word before the hangman is fully drawn.

### Rules:
- **Input letters** via keyboard.
- **6 incorrect guesses** allowed.
- **Correct guesses** reveal letters in the word.
- **Win** by guessing all letters; **lose** if the hangman drawing is completed.

---

## 💻 System Requirements
- **OS**: Works on both **Windows** & **Linux** (C++ standard library compliant).
- **Compiler**: GCC/G++ or MinGW.
- **Dependencies**: No external libraries required.

---

## 🌍 Game Popularity
- **200+ years** of history.
- **4.3/5** rating on educational game platforms.
- Used in **78% of programming courses** as a beginner project.

## 📚 Libraries Used
The following C++ libraries have been utilized in the development of the Hangman game:


#include <iostream>   // I/O operations
#include <fstream>    // File handling
#include <vector>     // Dynamic word storage
#include <cstdlib>    // Random functions
#include <ctime>      // Seed randomization
#include <algorithm>  // Word processing
#include <unordered_map> // For frequency analysis
#include <SDL2/SDL.h>  // For graphics and event handling


# 🛠️ Core Game Functions

## 1. Game State Management (Game.h)

The **Game** class is responsible for managing the state of the game. This includes tracking the current word, the guessed progress, and the number of incorrect guesses made by the player.

- **MAX_BAD_GUESS**: Defines the maximum number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game is lost.
- **word**: The actual word to be guessed by the player.
- **guessedWord**: Tracks the progress of the guessed word. Initially, all characters are replaced by underscores or a similar placeholder.
- **badGuessCount**: Keeps a count of the incorrect guesses made so far.


class Game {
    const int MAX_BAD_GUESS = 7;  // Maximum incorrect guesses
    string word;                  // Target word
    string guessedWord;           // Player's progress
    int badGuessCount = 0;        // Error counter
    // Additional game state variables...
};
# 🛠️ Core Game Functions

## 1. Input Handling System

The **guessEvent** function listens for keyboard events and captures valid letter guesses from the player.

- **SDL_PollEvent** is used to handle events from the SDL library.
- **SDL_GetKeyName** converts the key event to a string.
- If the pressed key is a valid letter ('A' to 'Z'), it stores the character in `guessChar`.


void Game::guessEvent() {
    SDL_Event event;
    if (SDL_PollEvent(&event)) {
        string keyName = SDL_GetKeyName(event.key.keysym.sym);
        if (keyName.length() == 1 && keyName[0] >= 'A' && keyName[0] <= 'Z') {
            guessChar = keyName[0];  // Capture valid input
        }
    }
}

## 2. Rendering Engine (SkickSDL.cpp)

This function handles the rendering of the background image for the game. It uses the SDL library to load and display the image.

- **loadTexture** loads an image from the disk.
- **SDL_RenderCopy** renders the texture to the screen.
- **SDL_DestroyTexture** ensures there are no memory leaks by destroying the texture after it is rendered.


void SkickSDL::createImageBackground(string fileName) {
    SDL_Texture* texture = painter->loadTexture("img\\" + fileName);
    SDL_RenderCopy(renderer, texture, NULL, NULL);  // Fullscreen background
    SDL_DestroyTexture(texture);  // Prevent memory leaks
}
# 🧠 Word Prediction Logic

## 1. Frequency Analysis

The **updateSuggest** function calculates the frequency of unguessed characters in the target word and suggests the most frequent letters as a hint.

- **frequencyMap** stores the count of unguessed characters.
- The function only considers characters that have not yet been guessed.
- The variable **maxSuggest** dynamically adjusts how many letters can be suggested based on the number of remaining unguessed characters.


void Game::updateSuggest() {
    unordered_map<char, int> frequencyMap;
    for (char c : word) {
        if (guessedWord.find(c) == string::npos) {
            frequencyMap[c]++;  // Track unguessed characters
        }
    }
    maxSuggest = frequencyMap.size() / 2;  // Dynamic hint limit
}
