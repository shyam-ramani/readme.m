## Project Overview

This Hangman game is a C++ application that uses SDL2 for rendering graphics, handling input, and managing the game window. Players guess letters to reveal a hidden word, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed before the hangman is fully drawn, resulting in a loss. The game includes:

- Multiple word categories (e.g., Fruits, Jobs, Plants)
- Two difficulty levels (Easy and Hard)
- A suggestion system (limited uses)
- A 90-second timer per game
- Animated graphics for hangman stages and win/lose outcomes
- Score tracking for wins and losses

The project is modular, split across several source files for maintainability and clarity.

---

## Prerequisites

To build and run the Hangman game, ensure you have the following installed:

- *C++ Compiler*: A modern compiler like MinGW (for Windows), GCC (Linux), or Clang (macOS).
- *SDL2 Library*: Core library for graphics, window management, and input.
  - Download from [SDL2 official site](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).
- *SDL2_image Library*: For loading PNG images.
  - Available at [SDL2_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/).
- *SDL2_ttf Library*: For rendering TrueType fonts.
  - Get it from [SDL2_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/).
- *CodeBlocks IDE* (Optional): For using the provided project file (hangman.cbp).
- *Font File*: VeraMoBd.ttf (included in the repository).
- *Assets*: Images in img/ and word lists in words/ (included in the repository).

On Windows, ensure the DLLs (SDL2.dll, SDL2_image.dll, SDL2_ttf.dll) are in the executable's directory or system path.

---

## Building the Project

You can build the project using CodeBlocks or manually with a compiler.

### Using CodeBlocks

1. Open hangman.cbp in CodeBlocks.
2. Ensure the compiler settings include paths to SDL2, SDL2_image, and SDL2_ttf libraries (preconfigured in the .cbp file).
3. Click "Build" or press F9 to compile and link the project.
4. The output executable (hangman.exe) will be in bin/Debug/ or bin/Release/, along with required DLLs, font, and assets.

### Manual Compilation

Use a command-line compiler like g++. Example command for Windows with MinGW:

bash
g++ -o hangman main.cpp Game.cpp SkickSDL.cpp painter.cpp utility.cpp -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf -I/path/to/SDL2/include -L/path/to/SDL2/lib


- Replace /path/to/SDL2/include and /path/to/SDL2/lib with the actual paths to your SDL2 installation.
- After compilation, manually copy the following to the directory with hangman.exe:
  - DLLs: SDL2.dll, SDL2_image.dll, SDL2_ttf.dll
  - Font: VeraMoBd.ttf
  - Directories: img/ (images) and words/ (word lists)

---

## Running the Game

After building:

1. Navigate to the output directory (e.g., bin/Debug/ or where hangman.exe is located).
2. Run the executable:
   bash
   hangman.exe
   
3. If manually compiled, ensure all required files (DLLs, font, img/, words/) are in the same directory as the executable.

The game window will open, and you can start playing.

---

## Gameplay

Hereâ€™s how to play the Hangman game:

- *Objective*: Guess the hidden word by suggesting letters.
- *Start*:
  - Select a word category (e.g., All Categories, Fruits, Jobs).
  - Choose a difficulty level (Easy or Hard).
- *Guessing*:
  - Press any letter key (A-Z) to guess.
  - Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word.
  - Incorrect guesses add parts to the hangman (up to 7 mistakes allowed).
- *Suggestions*:
  - Press the Spacebar to reveal a random unguessed letter (limited to 2 uses per game).
- *Time Limit*: You have 90 seconds to guess the word.
- *Win/Lose*:
  - *Win*: Guess the full word before 7 incorrect guesses or the timer runs out.
  - *Lose*: The hangman is fully drawn (7 parts) or time expires.
- *Post-Game*:
  - Press Enter to play again.
  - Press Esc to exit.

The screen displays:
- The current word (with dashes for unguessed letters)
- Incorrect guesses
- Remaining time
- Win/loss tally

---

## Key Features

- *Multiple Word Categories*: Options like Fruits, Asia Countries, Jobs, Plants, and All Categories.
- *Difficulty Levels*: Easy (shorter words) and Hard (longer words).
- *Suggestion System*: Up to 2 hints per game via the Spacebar.
- *Animated Graphics*: Visuals for hangman stages, win/lose screens, and a plane animation for correct guesses.
- *Timer*: 90-second limit per round.
- *Score Tracking*: Displays wins and losses across sessions.

---

## Code Overview

The project is organized into several files for modularity:

- **main.cpp**: Entry point, initializes SDL and starts the game loop.
- **Game.h / Game.cpp**: Core game logic, including state management and guessing mechanics.
- **SkickSDL.h / SkickSDL.cpp**: SDL wrapper for window, rendering, and event handling.
- **painter.h / painter.cpp**: Graphics utilities for drawing shapes, text, and images.
- **utility.h / utility.cpp**: Helper functions for string manipulation and word selection.
- **img/**: Directory with PNG images for hangman stages, win/lose screens, and animations.
- **words/**: Directory with text files (all.txt, fruits.txt, etc.) containing word lists.

---

## Data Structures Used

The game relies on these data structures:

- *Strings* (std::string):
  - Store the hidden word, current guess (e.g., "H--G--N"), and bad guesses (e.g., "X K P").
- *Vectors* (std::vector):
  - Hold word lists loaded from text files (e.g., vector<string> words).
- *Unordered Maps* (std::unordered_map):
  - Track unguessed letters for the suggestion system (e.g., mapping letters to their presence in the word).
- *SDL Structures*:
  - **SDL_Rect**: Defines positions and sizes for text and images on the screen.
  - **SDL_Texture**: Stores rendered graphics (e.g., text, images) for display.

---

## Libraries Used

The game leverages these external libraries:

- *SDL2*:
  - Purpose: Creates the game window, handles rendering, and processes input (keyboard events).
  - Version: 2.0 or later.
- *SDL2_image*:
  - Purpose: Loads PNG images for hangman stages and animations.
  - Supported formats: PNG (used exclusively in this project).
- *SDL2_ttf*:
  - Purpose: Renders text using TrueType fonts (e.g., VeraMoBd.ttf for game text).

These libraries are cross-platform, making the game portable to Windows, Linux, and macOS with minimal changes.

## Line-by-Line Code Analysis

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of key sections from Game.cpp to illustrate how the game works. (Note: This assumes a typical implementation; adjust if your code differs slightly.)

### startGame() in Game.cpp

```cpp
// Your C++ code here
void Game::startGame() {
    mistakes = 0;           // Reset mistake counter
    timeLeft = 90;          // Set timer to 90 seconds
    suggestionsLeft = 2;    // Allow 2 suggestions
    badGuesses = "";        // Clear bad guesses
    wins = wins;            // Retain win count
    losses = losses;        // Retain loss count
    chooseCategory();       // Prompt category selection
    chooseDifficulty();     // Prompt difficulty selection
    initWord();             // Select and set up the word
    gameState = PLAYING;    // Set game state to active
}
```




- *Line 1*: void Game::startGame() - Defines the function in the Game class.
- *Line 2*: mistakes = 0; - Resets the number of incorrect guesses.
- *Line 3*: timeLeft = 90; - Sets the timer to 90 seconds.
- *Line 4*: suggestionsLeft = 2; - Gives the player 2 hints.
- *Line 5*: badGuesses = ""; - Clears the string of incorrect guesses.
- *Line 6-7*: Retains the win/loss tally across games.
- *Line 8*: Calls chooseCategory() to let the player pick a category.
- *Line 9*: Calls chooseDifficulty() for difficulty selection.
- *Line 10*: Calls initWord() to pick and prepare the word.
- *Line 11*: Sets the game state to PLAYING, starting the main loop.

### handleGuess(char guess) in Game.cpp

cpp
void Game::handleGuess(char guess) {
    string normGuess = normalize(string(1, guess));
    if (badGuesses.find(normGuess) != string::npos || currentWord.find(normGuess) != string::npos) {
        return;  // Ignore repeated guesses
    }
    if (contains(wordToGuess, guess)) {
        for (int i = 0; i < wordToGuess.length(); i++) {
            if (wordToGuess[i] == guess) {
                currentWord[i] = guess;  // Reveal letter
            }
        }
        if (currentWord == wordToGuess) {
            gameState = WON;  // Player wins
        }
    } else {
        mistakes++;
        badGuesses += normGuess + " ";
        if (mistakes >= 7) {
            gameState = LOST;  // Player loses
        }
    }
}


- *Line 1*: Defines the function to process a guess.
- *Line 2*: Normalizes the guess to uppercase for consistency.
- *Line 3*: Checks if the guess was already made (in badGuesses or currentWord).
- *Line 4*: Returns early if the guess is a repeat.
- *Line 5*: Checks if the guess is in the word using contains().
- *Line 6-10*: Loops through the word, revealing all instances of the guessed letter.
- *Line 11-13*: If the full word is guessed, sets the state to WON.
- *Line 14-18*: If incorrect, increments mistakes, adds to badGuesses, and checks for loss (7 mistakes).
